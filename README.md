# diffusive-offline-rl-portfolio-optimizer
This is a school project for a subject I learnt in Artificial Intelligence to make control systems. In the project, we devised and implemented a novel method learning the derivative of objective function on the portfolio, which makes the algorithm can generate a diverse set of possible portfolio, great for diversification.

The project used data from cophieu68.com which was designed for Amibroker software.
Inside model folder, model.ipynb contains the layout and training loop; data_generator.ipynb contains functions to generate linear regression slopes; validate.ipynb contains test and measurement on unseen data (validation data: 28/3/2022, training data < 2017)
